# deep-learning-projects

This repository contains mini projects in deep learning that I have done while studying the concepts using tensorFlow.

## Project1. Gradschool Acceptance Prediction Model

[Source Code](https://github.com/nadia506/deep-learning-projects/tree/main/Gradschool-Acceptance-Probability)

For this project, I used synthetic datasets which consists of GRE scores, GPA, the rankings of the graduate school to which applicants applied, and whether or not they got accepted. Based on this data, I create a model that predicts the likelihood of acceptance of graudeate school.

## Project2. Image Classification Model with Convolution Layer (CNN)

[Source Code](https://github.com/nadia506/deep-learning-projects/tree/main/Image-Classification-Clothing)

In this project, I developed a Convoluional Neural network to classify gray-scale images of clothings. I used the open dataset that are already pre-processed provided by keras. I used convolution layers to extract features from the images and pooling layers to retain important information.

## Project3. Cat vs. Dog Image Classification

This project features a deep learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs. I utilized a dataset from Kaggle and preprocessed the data with keras to prepare the data. Additionaly, to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalizability, I used On-the-fly image augmentation strategies.
